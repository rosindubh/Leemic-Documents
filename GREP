SYNTAX
--------------------------------------------------------
grep 'text you are searching for here in inverted commas' <file_name here>-
--------------------------------------------------------

eg:-
grep 'clutch' MASTER.txt

Switches that can be added to improve the search:-

w = search for a whole word
i = makes the search non case sensitive
n = gives the line number

-A 2 will give the 2 lines after
-B 2 will give the 2 lines before
-C 2 will give the 2 lines before and after

eg:-
grep -win -C 2 'machine' MASTER.txt

This will search for the word 'machine' as a whole word, ie not 'machines',
both upper and lower case. It will give the line number and the 2 lines 
before and after the word 'machine'.

To search all the files in a given directory add:-
./* in place of the file name.

eg:-
grep -win -C 2 'machine' ./*
