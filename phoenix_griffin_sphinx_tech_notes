OPTIONAL EXIT TRAY
------------------
All models in the CR4 range can now output documents from fax, 
copy or print sources separately thanks to the addition of 
optional exit trays.

MX-TR20 Separator tray can be fitted with the Centre exit tray 
(MX-TU16) or The Relay unit (MX-RB25) giving an extra output 
tray when using an external Finisher. (Cannot be used with MX-FN27 
Internal finisher).

MOTION SENSOR
-------------
The motion sensor can be activated in System settings - Eco settings 
- Sleep mode power level. Default setting is 'Off', there is a drop 
down menu to switch to 'On'.

EASY SCAN/COPY/FAX
------------------
As well as easy copy mode there is also easy scan and easy fax modes 
which simplify the options with the selected screen. These options 
are only on the new Phoenix/Griffin.

The Phoenix/Griffin series, now automatically sets resolution/blank 
page skip/simplex or duplex/correction of original direction by 
pressing "Auto settings" on easy scan mode.

NEW SCREEN ICON ADDED
---------------------
A new screen Icon, LAN cable connection has been added to help fault 
find a poor (or no) network connection. This can be turned on or off 
via system settings. As well as the LAN cable icon, there is a new 
message for fax transmission "Sending has failed" for example if the 
cable is not connected during the time of fax transmission.

ESTIMATED JOB START TIME
------------------------

Estimated Job Start Time. Technicians can select ON/OFF to display 
this function for enabling and disabling the setting by using 
SIM 55-3 SW 35-1

(default is OFF)

PREVIEW IMAGES BEFORE PRINTING
------------------------------

Phoenix/Griffin models now offer the ability to preview images and 
files on screen directly from for example, a USB storage device, 
before printing.

PS / PDF files are not supported as standard and need to be enabled 
in SIM 55-03 SW34 bit 3

DOWNLOAD SCAN TO HDD
--------------------

with SMB enabled means scanned documents can be saved and be 
downloadable from the internal HDD.

SECURITY
--------
HCD-PP is the successor to IEEE2600.x and is the new industry standard. 
Sharp are at the forefront by incorporating HCD-PP standards into all 
models in the CR4 range.

REMOVE TONER CARTRIDGE
----------------------

Remove toner cartridge button is in the system settings when logged in
as administrator. Also can be done using SIM 10-3

SIM MODE
--------

There is now an easy mode for simulation. This can be toggled with the
Classic mode by pressing the mode setting key at the top of the display.

6) Print Release Settings Guide

7) Troubleshooting

When logged into the service web page there are up to 20 different
paper types that can be set up in the 'Paper Settings' menu.


PRINT RELEASE
-------------
This serverless Print Release feature uses an MFP as a print server (primary)
and up to 5 additional MFP's (secondary) can be intergrated into the system
to function within a closed sub-network. This feature provides better data
protection, increases user friendliness and also saves resources as misprints
are minimised.

TO CONFIGURE BEST TO CONSULT THE PRINT 
RELEASE  SETUP  GUIDE  FOR THE MACHINE

THE FOLLOWING  SETTINGS  MUST  BE MADE
-----------------------------------
1) System Settings - Printer Settings - print release settings
2) System Settings - Secutity Settings - Port Settings
3) Polling pressure button up on Home screen.
4) Driver Setting Tab Card Job Handling-> 'print release'

OCR scan
--------
The Phoenix/Griffin models incorporate an OCR function. This function
supports searchable PDF and scan to office documents (Word, Excel and
Powerpoint).
If a replacement HDD is required you will need to update the new HDD 
with OCR and Watermark data for the machine to work corectly.

MS Office files
---------------
Direct printing from Microsoft Office is now available on CR4 from
USB, portable devices, the Cloud and of course MFP's and printers.

* For better linking of MFPs, mobile devices and cloud capabilities 
MS Office files can be directly printed without a PC and MS Office 
software on the Phoenix. 

Multi Crop Scan
---------------

MFP scans multiple originals on the platen, this will allow the customer
to copy small documents from the glass and it will output each of the
small documents (e.g. receipts) onto one page per document. So 4 receipts
are placed onto the glass, one scan and 4 pages will be printed with one
receipt on each page.

Business Card Scanning
----------------------

By utilising the OCR and Multi Crop Scan function the machine is capable of
creating a list of business cards in electronic format for easy searching
of contacts.

Cloud Connectivity
------------------

Cloud connectivity had never been easier with the public cloud connection.
There are many other Cloud devices, such as OneDrive, Sharepoint and Google
Drive with an SSO function (Single Sign On) it has never been as easy to 
connect your MFP to a cloud device.

Cloud Connection Feature means that the MFP and Cloud services connects
without an external server.

The Users which have a cloud account can upload scan data and print the
stored data via MFP.

Microsoft OneDrive and Sharepoint:

These services are included in the various Office 365 packages. This
service is not sold sigular. OneDrive and SharePoint connectors supports
the Office 365 Authentication method (Claim base authentication). Other
methods such as ADFS authentication are not supported.

Google Drive:
All users start Google connector using their user's Google account.

Effciency and productivity
--------------------------

Single Sign-On

Single Sign-On for cloud systems like Goolge Drive, Sharepoint and One Drive
allows for faster access to documents. Users no longer have to authenticate
multiple times in order to obtain access to cloud services. This information
is now associated with the registration process on the multifunction 
product, which means that to retrieve the desired documents fewer steps are
required.

USB-Direct print

With the Direct Print feature, in addition to the types of documents already
available (.tiff, .jpeg, .txt and pdf files), MS Office files (.docx, .xlsx
and .pptx files) are printed directly (from Office 2010).

On the model MX-**60/70N, available by default.

INSTALLATION
------------

It is reccommended that all the output options are installed before the
developer installation procedure is initialised, otherwise an L4-11 error
message will appear. If this is not possible for whatever reason, you can
turn off the soft switch Sim 55-1, SW 24, Bit 7 temporarily. However do not
forget to reset the switch to the initial position after the installation.

DRUM
----

The consumable life is specified by 1,350K (OPC Drum) or 2,700K (Developer) rotations.
The Phoenix Griffin range drum life is now 1,6 times longer than that of Virgo
(MX4140/5140N). There is also a new shaped main charger grid for optimal performance.
The position of the drum now makes more even pressure on the cleaning blade.

Maintenance DK, DC, DM, DY will indicate when the specified number of pages or
rotations is reached as per previous Sharp models.

MC Grid Bias for all colours is 592+/_5V Middle speed & 583+/-V Low speed

DEVELOPER
---------

Long life developer

The consumable life is specified by 1,350K (OPC Drum) or 2,700K (Developer) rotations.
Therefore the page count life indicated below is for approximate guidence only.

			
				MX-2630		MX-3070N/MX-3570N		MX-4070N

MX-60GVBA Black Developer	360K		400K				500K

MX-60GVSA Colour Developer	300K		300K				400K

Phoenix/Griffin has an improved developer refresh system up to 3.2 times longer than
Virgo (MX-4140/5140) range.

Toner and carrier in the developing unit are agitated and transported by the mixing
roller. By stirring, toner and carrier are negatively charged by mechanical friction.
The developing bias voltage (AC component and negative DC component) is applied to the 
developing roller. Negatively charged toner is attracted to the exposed section on the
OPC drum where the negative potential fails due to the developing bias. If the OPC 
drum is not exposed, the negative potential is higher than the developing bias voltage, 
and toner is not attracted. The toner sensor detects the toner supply state from the
toner cartridge. In this machine, the toner density is detected by the toner sensor,
but the toner supply operation is not controlled only by the toner density detection
result. The toner density control is performed according to the process control data.
Developer Bias For all colours is all models is -450+/-5V.

FUSER
-----

Note:-
Phoenix/Griffin fusers no longer have a cleaning web. The features of the
belt-type fusing system are shorter warm-up time, lower power consumtion
and a wider nip width.

The fusing pressure control motor (PRM) rotates to turn ON the fusing pressure
detector (HLPCD). Pressure release occurs when the machine shifts to the 
preheat mode, when the machine shifts to the auto power shut off mode, when
the power switch or the operation panel is turned OFF, when in envelope mode
and finally when a jam occurs.

New type thermostat is a fast responce and importantly non-resettable.
Do not touch the dome as damage will cause incorrect temperature readings.

IMPORTANT NOTE when replacing the PCU PWB the fuser must be removed until
message on the screen appears (install fuser unit). Check Technical Handy
Guide or Service Manual page 10-26. 

Note:-
This action must be done when installing a new fuser unit as well.

MX-407FU	Fusing Unit 230v	--------- for service rotation ---------


DO NOT DISSASSEMBLE THE FUSER BELT UNIT AS IT IS FACTORY SET.
There is no cleaning web for the 30/35/40 PPM machines.

TRANSFER
--------

Transfer Operation.
A high positive voltage is applied to the primary transfer roller to transfer
toner image from the OPC drum to the primary transfer belt.
Negative electronic charges are generated by the PTC unit, supplying negative
charges to toner. This operation improves the transfer effiency in the 
secondary transfer. Then a high negative voltage is applied to the primary
transfer drive roller, to transfer toner images from the primary transfer
belt to paper.

NOTE when removing the waste toner cleaning unit be sure to turn the
transfer unit upside down and lift away from the cleaning unit to avoid
spillage.

In the secondary transfer unit a high positive voltage is applied to the
primary transfer belt to attach unwanted toner to the primary transfer belt,
and it is then cleaned by the primary transfer belt cleaning unit.

WASTE TONER
-----------
Waste Toner full detection sensor (TNFD)
If the waste toner box is emptied it will still show as full until the 
actuator arm is manually released. This is best done using a pair of long
nosed pliers or similar to release the clutch.

LASER UNIT (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emmision of Radiation)
----------

Within the Griffin range a single channel laser beam configuration is used
to give 600dpi, whilst output on the Phoenix range is 1200dpi thanks to twin
channel laser beam configuration.

MAIN DRIVE
----------
The main drive units are:-
1) the main drive unit
2) the transport drive unit
3) the fusing drive unit
4) the paper exit drive unit

NOTE:- there are two drum drive motors one for the black drum, dev and
transfer and one for the colour drum and dev units. The 50/60PM machines will
have four drum motors and a transfer drive motor.

The main drive unit can easily be accessed by opening up the PCU and MC PCBs
which are hinged. The unit can then be removed and is held in by six screws,
remembering first to disengage the drums, developer units and transfer belt.
