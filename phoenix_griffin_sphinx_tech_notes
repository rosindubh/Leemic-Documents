copy or print sources separately thanks to the addition of 
optional exit trays.

MX-TR20 Separator tray can be fitted with the Centre exit tray 
(MX-TU16) or The Relay unit (MX-RB25) giving an extra output 
tray when using an external Finisher. (Cannot be used with MX-FN27 
Internal finisher).

MOTION SENSOR
-------------
The motion sensor can be activated in System settings - Eco settings 
- Sleep mode power level. Default setting is 'Off', there is a drop 
down menu to switch to 'On'.

EASY SCAN/COPY/FAX
------------------
As well as easy copy mode there is also easy scan and easy fax modes 
which simplify the options with the selected screen. These options 
are only on the new Phoenix/Griffin.

The Phoenix/Griffin series, now automatically sets resolution/blank 
page skip/simplex or duplex/correction of original direction by 
pressing "Auto settings" on easy scan mode.

NEW SCREEN ICON ADDED
---------------------
A new screen Icon, LAN cable connection has been added to help fault 
find a poor (or no) network connection. This can be turned on or off 
via system settings. As well as the LAN cable icon, there is a new 
message for fax transmission "Sending has failed" for example if the 
cable is not connected during the time of fax transmission.

ESTIMATED JOB START TIME
------------------------

Estimated Job Start Time. Technicians can select ON/OFF to display 
this function for enabling and disabling the setting by using 
SIM 55-3 SW 35-1

(default is OFF)

PREVIEW IMAGES BEFORE PRINTING
------------------------------

Phoenix/Griffin models now offer the ability to preview images and 
files on screen directly from for example, a USB storage device, 
before printing.

PS / PDF files are not supported as standard and need to be enabled 
in SIM 55-03 SW34 bit 3

DOWNLOAD SCAN TO HDD
--------------------

with SMB enabled means scanned documents can be saved and be 
downloadable from the internal HDD.

SECURITY
--------
HCD-PP is the successor to IEEE2600.x and is the new industry standard. 
Sharp are at the forefront by incorporating HCD-PP standards into all 
models in the CR4 range.

REMOVE TONER CARTRIDGE
----------------------

Remove toner cartridge button is in the system settings when logged in
as administrator. Also can be done using SIM 10-3

SIM MODE
--------

There is now an easy mode for simulation. This can be toggled with the
Classic mode by pressing the mode setting key at the top of the display.

NEW/CHANGED SIMULALTIONS
------------------------

Sim 06-09	Scanner lock position
Sim 08-10	MC total current setting
Sim 10-03	Test of toner discharge sensors
Sim 22-14	Toner cartridge counter
Sim 22-41	Jam code list and content. Note 3 new jam types registered

_LE  = Life end(feed roller counter reached life)
_RT  = Retry. (The PF rollers have tried to re-feed, worn rollers)
_1st = First sheet jam. (1st sheet of paper since draw closed has jammed)


Sim 22-43	Lists jam history, date time counter etc
Sim 25-10	Developer/drum serial number setting
Sim 26-10	Additional setting of Job separator
Sim 26-66	Simulation Password set (4 digit 0-9, preset 0000) refer to
		Sim 26-85
Sim 26-71	Trial mode Web browsing kit - no longer available
Sim 26-79	Security setting (Sim Lock Function) SEE NOTE BELOW

NOTE
----
The method to enter service simulation mode on previous machines was open to 
the public. Simulation Mode password protection is needed for security 
management. Service personnel can select whether it enable or disable 
(Factory Default is “OFF”).

Sim 56-08	Sim for downloading ICC profile has newly been established
		(same as web page)
Sim 56-99	Save various log data all at once to USB memory. Includes
		Sim 56-04, 56-05, 56-06, 56-07, 00-11
Sim 61-11	Adjustment density has been changed
Sim 61-14	Sim for setting each laser power at the same time has been
		added. One point -> 10%
Sim 26-79	Security setting
		'Service'-password required for entering Sim mode.
		Default: service
		Technician can set this setting to 'ON' by changing Sim 26-79
		from '0' to '1'.

		Mode to Classic Mode. Passcode required, refer to Sim 26-66

NOTE
----
Sim 26-85 turns on and off the password protection from easy to classic mode
for simulation. The UK market goes straight into classic simulation mode, so
the password setting is redundant.
