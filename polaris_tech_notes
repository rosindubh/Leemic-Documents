PERIPHERALS
-----------

MX-LC13N

The 5,000 sheet Large Capacity Tray (MX-LC13N) incorporates an advanced paper handling 
'Triple Air Feed' system which brings many advantages compared to a traditional friction feed system. 
It not only ensures the reliable feeding of coated and heavy weights but also provides greater accuracy of 
registration

Since the air separates, assists and vacuum feeds the paper into the print engine it prevents roller feeder 
marks on the paper.   Moreover, temperature sensors stabilise the paper condition to reduce static on coated 
stocks increasing print quality.

Definition of developer/drum life end.

When the developer/drum counter reaches the specified count.
When the developer/drum rpm reaches the specified count.
When either of the above reach the specified count, it is judged as life end.

In an actual case, the ratio of monochrome output and colour output may differ greatly.
When data of mixed documents (monochrome and colour) are output, monochrome 
document data may be output in the colour mode in order to prevent against fall in the job efficiency. 
(ACS auto colour selection).
In addition, when correction or warm-up operation is performed as well as output operation, 
the developer and the drum rotates.
Therefore, the developer/drum consuming level cannot be determined only by the copy/print quantity. 
When, therefore, the rpm reaches the specified amount, it is judged as life end.
To check the developer/drum life, use SIM22-13.

PULL PRINTING
-------------

The MX-7580N / MX-6580N and MX-7090N / MX-8090N series MFP's have a built-in Print Release capability. 
This is the same feature found on our latest range of office MFP's, users can send their print jobs to 
the master MFP which acts as the server.  From there, users can print the data from up to five client 
MFP's on the same network. 

Note: This function will be lost if the EFI Fiery option has been fitted

This means that even if someone is using the MFP and/or if the MFP cannot be used because of maintenance, 
as long as the machine set-up as the primary remains switched on, users can print the data at another 
available MFP on the same network without waiting.  

Furthermore, if no user authentication is enabled all users will see all jobs, for enhanced security 
when using this feature, it is necessary for user authentication to be enabled and for them to provide authentication.

As there is no need for a separate print server or additional software, 
this low cost pull printing solution is ideal for organisations who already 
have our latest MFP range and want basic control over their printing with 
higher flexibility.

SCREEN
------

The MX-6580N and MX-7580N both have the same built-in 10.1” multi-touch finger swipe touch colour LCD 
control panel as the CR4 as standard, users are guided step by step through operational procedures.  
This third generation touch screen is the fastest in the Sharp range meaning that users will be able 
to have a seamless experience at the MFP. 

The MX-7090N and MX8090N has a new 15.4" touch screen with all the same features and operational 
procedures as the 10.1" screen but with higher clarity, this is so that when the external fiery (MX-PE13) 
is installed the CWS (Command Work Station) can be viewed clearly.

Additionally, the retractable QWERTY keyboard (MX-KB13) enables easy text entry 
providing users more flexibility should they need it.

The CR4 screens make it easy for the operater to gain assistance on all aspects of the machine, including:

*  Downloading and printing manuals

*  Loading paper and placing originals

*  Operating the machine

*  Maintenance

It then walks you through a step by step process how to download a manual in PDF format.

BUSINESS CARD SCANNING
----------------------

When dealing with business cards, the MX-7580N and MX-6580N is able to digitise texts through the embedded OCR 
feature and then send and save as vCard or CSV formats.
Combining this with the multi-crop feature simultaneously, multiple cards can be read at one scanning.  
Furthermore, information scanned from business cards can be imported to e-mail applications such as exchange 
mailers.  Thus, making business card management a much easier task.Business Card Scanning

CONSISTENCY ACROSS LONG PRINT RUNS
-----------------------------------

With a maximum paper capacity of 8,500 sheets, the MX-7580N and MX-6580N enables a large number of 
print/copy jobs to be executed without interruption

To ensure image quality stability from the first page to the last, MX-7580N and MX6580N adopts 
Sharp’s Developer Refresh System.
The mixed toner and carrier are delivered from toner cartridge to the developing unit to reduce the 
deterioration of developer.  
As a result, this technology provides stable image quality on long print runs and ensures that image 
quality is maintained between PM cycles.

SCANNNER ASSEMBLY AND SCANNER LAMPS
-----------------------------------

The new Polaris office 2 (MX6580N - MX7580N) uses the new SIT chart used for the CR4 range of machines.
This SIT chart is used for accurately calibrating the CCD array housed in both the optics cavity and DSPF.
Please refer to Adjustment section 7A and 18B in the service manual

A new scanner lamp has been designed that incorporates 2 side lit waveguide sticks and 4 low power LED's. 
This can be achieved by the use of a brand new high sensitivity CCD array producing better quality but using 
less power

The scanner drive capstan has been changed from a metal drive to a new plastic drive.
The screw has been removed and therefore optical skew cannot now be adjusted using this method

Optical skew adjustment is now performed on the lamp carriage itself.
See adjustment 4A in the Service Manual

DSPF
----

The DSPF is the same as the CR4 type

    Scanner lamps are the same as you have just seen in the Optics cavity section (changed from Polaris 1 - 72 
    LED's or Phoenix -48 LED's) the new scanner assembly utilises 2 side lit waveguide sticks and 4 low power 
    LED's
    Polaris 1 DSPF uses stepper motors, Polaris 2 uses a brushed DC motor with a new control PWB

LASER UNIT
----------

1. The LSU shutter assembly has now been removed from Polaris 2
2. The addition of 4 new style lenses, which sit just under each drum module,  for improved performance and 
increased scanning width from 310mm to 330mm 
3. Removal of 1 focusing lens internally
4. Addition of noise reduction material around polygon motor for improved sound proofing

PROCESS UNITS (DEVELOPER TANKS)

Polaris Office 1 (MX6240N/7040N)
D.S.D. Gap = 0.50mm
Doctor Gap = 0.775mm

Polaris Office 2 (MX6580N/7580N)
D.S.D. Gap = 0.40mm
Doctor Gap = 0.70mm
Colour = Light Grey

Polaris 2 has new developer filters with finer mesh to reduce toner scatter
NOTE: These filters should be replaced at every drum change.

200K Colour
300K Black

Beware: vacuuming the filters will loosen the fibres and contaminate the developer. 

The urethane seal on the upper cover has been increased in length from 8mm to 10mm to reduce toner scatter 

The Developer drive coupling has changed to a more direct drive, the same as Polaris Pro 1. 
This also incorporates a locating pin for more accurate developer positioning. 

The developer tank also has a different mechanical key and CRUM chip as the units are not inter-changeable 
between models 

PROCESS UNITS (DRUM MODULES)
----------------------------

The grid on the main charge has been modified to improve the stability of the electrostatic charge, the width 
and the pitch has been increased.

The main charge holder has a mechanical key, as these are NOT interchangeable with earlier models

The Polaris office 1 and Polaris Pro 1 is black

The Polaris office 2 is grey

In area 1 of the new Main Charge a rib has been added

In area 2 of the new Main charge a cut has been made


The Drum Module has also had mechanical keys added and changed from the previous models to assist in not 
being able to make a mistake and fit the incorrect unit to the particular model.
As discussed earlier in the developer tank module, each model has different D.S.D. and doctor blade gap, 
therefore these mechanical keys have been added to avoid quality issues from fitting the incorrect units.

***  Note: Main Charge NOT Interchangeable ***

FUSER
-----

 The fuser unit for Polaris office 2 (MX6580N – MX7580N) is a new fuser unit for this model and 
not backward compatible with previous models, this is due to a specification change of image 
quality assurance range •  Polaris office 1 has a guaranteed quality width of 303mm allowing for 
A3 and A4 + 3mm either side. •  Polaris office 2 has been increased to 319mm

Wiring harness is different compare to Polaris 1 ; If the wrong fuser unit is installed you will 
encounter a fusing error code (H2-06) 

Lower separation pawl was added (4 to 5) in order to improve the transportation of invoice paper size. 
(same as Polaris Pro) 

Since there are many types of paper with various paper weights on the market, 
it is necessary to execute fuser temperature adjustment properly according to 
paper weights. The fuser temperature adjustment SW for plain paper 
(which is set according to the paper weight) has been available since CR3. 
However, it is set deep in the hierarchy of System Settings which doesn’t help 
to reduce service calls. The setting has now been moved from 
“System settings” “Device Control” to Paper type for plain paper “Plain” is now 
divided into “Plain 1” and “Plain 2”.

TRANSFER UNITS
--------------

A new oil impregnated roller has been added for improved cleaning after image transfer. 
This will reduce staple effect on the primary transfer belt. The roller is grounded to 
help remove charge from the belt and moves up and down with the black transfer roller.

New toner scatter prevention seals have been added to the primary transfer frame to 
reduce toner contamination from getting inside the transfer belt and onto the transfer rollers (same as CR4).
The DRS gap between the drum and developer mag roller has also been adjusted (as seen in the process section) 
and the toner density table has also been optimised to reduce toner scatter.

A new Primary transfer blade has been introduced featuring a new Mylar:
1. New Mylar
2. Primary transfer belt
3. Cleaning Blade

The Mylar has been added to the backside of the primary transfer blade so that waste toner can be 
transported along the complete length of the blade for even lubrication, therefore reducing friction 
and the possibility of blade flip.

A flywheel has been added to the primary transfer to increase drive stability
The drive gear has also been improved for a more smooth drive, reducing speed variation and improving banding.
Note: Both of these improvements are from the Polaris Pro (MX6500N - MX7500N)

Other improvements are the drive gears on the cleaner unit, the number of the teeth has doubled so that the 
drive is more stable, reducing the possibility of low frequency banding.
The material used in the cleaner unit has also changed, the lower section has been reinforced with sheet metal 
for more stability.

The angle of the secondary transfer unit has been changed by adding spacers to the primary transfer unit to 
reduce banding on heavy paper stock.
The hardness of the secondary transfer roller has also been reduced from 45 to 38 to improve toner scatter.
Hardness measured using the Rockwell Hardness method
The primary transfer unit is fully backward compatible with both the Polaris office 1 and Polari Pro 1.
Note If the MX-751U1 (Primary unit for Polaris Office 2) is used in the previous models then the spacers 
mentioned above should be removed. As a precaution a reminder sheet (seen left) will be included in the 
MX-751 box
