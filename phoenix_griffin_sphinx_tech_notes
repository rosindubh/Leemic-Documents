OPTIONAL EXIT TRAY
------------------
All models in the CR4 range can now output documents from fax, 
copy or print sources separately thanks to the addition of 
optional exit trays.

MX-TR20 Separator tray can be fitted with the Centre exit tray 
(MX-TU16) or The Relay unit (MX-RB25) giving an extra output 
tray when using an external Finisher. (Cannot be used with MX-FN27 
Internal finisher).

MOTION SENSOR
-------------
The motion sensor can be activated in System settings - Eco settings 
- Sleep mode power level. Default setting is 'Off', there is a drop 
down menu to switch to 'On'.

EASY SCAN/COPY/FAX
------------------
As well as easy copy mode there is also easy scan and easy fax modes 
which simplify the options with the selected screen. These options 
are only on the new Phoenix/Griffin.

The Phoenix/Griffin series, now automatically sets resolution/blank 
page skip/simplex or duplex/correction of original direction by 
pressing "Auto settings" on easy scan mode.

NEW SCREEN ICON ADDED
---------------------
A new screen Icon, LAN cable connection has been added to help fault 
find a poor (or no) network connection. This can be turned on or off 
via system settings. As well as the LAN cable icon, there is a new 
message for fax transmission "Sending has failed" for example if the 
cable is not connected during the time of fax transmission.

ESTIMATED JOB START TIME
------------------------

Estimated Job Start Time. Technicians can select ON/OFF to display 
this function for enabling and disabling the setting by using 
SIM 55-3 SW 35-1

(default is OFF)

PREVIEW IMAGES BEFORE PRINTING
------------------------------

Phoenix/Griffin models now offer the ability to preview images and 
files on screen directly from for example, a USB storage device, 
before printing.

PS / PDF files are not supported as standard and need to be enabled 
in SIM 55-03 SW34 bit 3

DOWNLOAD SCAN TO HDD
--------------------

with SMB enabled means scanned documents can be saved and be 
downloadable from the internal HDD.

SECURITY
--------
HCD-PP is the successor to IEEE2600.x and is the new industry standard. 
Sharp are at the forefront by incorporating HCD-PP standards into all 
models in the CR4 range.

REMOVE TONER CARTRIDGE
----------------------

Remove toner cartridge button is in the system settings when logged in
as administrator. Also can be done using SIM 10-3

SIM MODE
--------

There is now an easy mode for simulation. This can be toggled with the
Classic mode by pressing the mode setting key at the top of the display.

When logged into the service web page there are up to 20 different
paper types that can be set up in the 'Paper Settings' menu.


PRINT RELEASE
-------------
This serverless Print Release feature uses an MFP as a print server (primary)
and up to 5 additional MFP's (secondary) can be integrated into the system
to function within a closed sub-network. This feature provides better data
protection, increases user friendliness and also saves resources as misprints
are minimised.

TO CONFIGURE BEST TO CONSULT THE PRINT 
RELEASE  SETUP  GUIDE  FOR THE MACHINE

THE FOLLOWING  SETTINGS  MUST  BE MADE
-----------------------------------
1) System Settings - Printer Settings - print release settings
2) System Settings - Security Settings - Port Settings
3) Polling pressure button up on Home screen.
4) Driver Setting Tab Card Job Handling-> 'print release'

OCR scan
--------
The Phoenix/Griffin models incorporate an OCR function. This function
supports searchable PDF and scan to office documents (Word, Excel and
Powerpoint).
If a replacement HDD is required you will need to update the new HDD 
with OCR and Watermark data for the machine to work correctly.

MS Office files
---------------
Direct printing from Microsoft Office is now available on CR4 from
USB, portable devices, the Cloud and of course MFP's and printers.

* For better linking of MFPs, mobile devices and cloud capabilities 
MS Office files can be directly printed without a PC and MS Office 
software on the Phoenix. 

Multi Crop Scan
---------------

MFP scans multiple originals on the platen, this will allow the customer
to copy small documents from the glass and it will output each of the
small documents (e.g. receipts) onto one page per document. So 4 receipts
are placed onto the glass, one scan and 4 pages will be printed with one
receipt on each page.

Business Card Scanning
----------------------

By utilising the OCR and Multi Crop Scan function the machine is capable of
creating a list of business cards in electronic format for easy searching
of contacts.

Cloud Connectivity
------------------

Cloud connectivity had never been easier with the public cloud connection.
There are many other Cloud devices, such as OneDrive, Sharepoint and Google
Drive with an SSO function (Single Sign On) it has never been as easy to 
connect your MFP to a cloud device.

Cloud Connection Feature means that the MFP and Cloud services connects
without an external server.

The Users which have a cloud account can upload scan data and print the
stored data via MFP.

Microsoft OneDrive and Sharepoint:

These services are included in the various Office 365 packages. This
service is not sold singular. OneDrive and SharePoint connectors supports
the Office 365 Authentication method (Claim base authentication). Other
methods such as ADFS authentication are not supported.

Google Drive:
All users start Google connector using their user's Google account.

Efficiency and productivity
--------------------------

Single Sign-On

Single Sign-On for cloud systems like Google Drive, Sharepoint and One Drive
allows for faster access to documents. Users no longer have to authenticate
multiple times in order to obtain access to cloud services. This information
is now associated with the registration process on the multifunction 
product, which means that to retrieve the desired documents fewer steps are
required.

USB-Direct print

With the Direct Print feature, in addition to the types of documents already
available (.tiff, .jpeg, .txt and pdf files), MS Office files (.docx, .xlsx
and .pptx files) are printed directly (from Office 2010).

On the model MX-**60/70N, available by default.

INSTALLATION
------------

It is recommended that all the output options are installed before the
developer installation procedure is initialised, otherwise an L4-11 error
message will appear. If this is not possible for whatever reason, you can
turn off the soft switch Sim 55-1, SW 24, Bit 7 temporarily. However do not
forget to reset the switch to the initial position after the installation.

DRUM
----

The consumable life is specified by 1,350K (OPC Drum) or 2,700K (Developer) rotations.
The Phoenix Griffin range drum life is now 1,6 times longer than that of Virgo
(MX4140/5140N). There is also a new shaped main charger grid for optimal performance.
The position of the drum now makes more even pressure on the cleaning blade.

Maintenance DK, DC, DM, DY will indicate when the specified number of pages or
rotations is reached as per previous Sharp models.

MC Grid Bias for all colours is 592+/-5V Middle speed & 583+/-5V Low speed

DEVELOPER
---------

Long life developer

The consumable life is specified by 1,350K (OPC Drum) or 2,700K (Developer) rotations.
Therefore the page count life indicated below is for approximate guidance only.

			
				MX-2630		MX-3070N/MX-3570N		MX-4070N

MX-60GVBA Black Developer	360K		400K				500K

MX-60GVSA Colour Developer	300K		300K				400K

Phoenix/Griffin has an improved developer refresh system up to 3.2 times longer than
Virgo (MX-4140/5140) range.

Toner and carrier in the developing unit are agitated and transported by the mixing
roller. By stirring, toner and carrier are negatively charged by mechanical friction.
The developing bias voltage (AC component and negative DC component) is applied to the 
developing roller. Negatively charged toner is attracted to the exposed section on the
OPC drum where the negative potential fails due to the developing bias. If the OPC 
drum is not exposed, the negative potential is higher than the developing bias voltage, 
and toner is not attracted. The toner sensor detects the toner supply state from the
toner cartridge. In this machine, the toner density is detected by the toner sensor,
but the toner supply operation is not controlled only by the toner density detection
result. The toner density control is performed according to the process control data.
Developer Bias For all colours is all models is -450+/-5V.

FUSER
-----

Note:-
Phoenix/Griffin fusers no longer have a cleaning web. The features of the
belt-type fusing system are shorter warm-up time, lower power consumption
and a wider nip width.

The fusing pressure control motor (PRM) rotates to turn ON the fusing pressure
detector (HLPCD). Pressure release occurs when the machine shifts to the 
preheat mode, when the machine shifts to the auto power shut off mode, when
the power switch or the operation panel is turned OFF, when in envelope mode
and finally when a jam occurs.

New type thermostat is a fast response and importantly non-resettable.
Do not touch the dome as damage will cause incorrect temperature readings.

IMPORTANT NOTE when replacing the PCU PWB the fuser must be removed until
message on the screen appears (install fuser unit). Check Technical Handy
Guide or Service Manual page 10-26. 

Note:-
This action must be done when installing a new fuser unit as well.

DO NOT DISASSEMBLE THE FUSER BELT UNIT AS IT IS FACTORY SET.
There is no cleaning web for the 30/35/40 PPM machines.

TRANSFER
--------

Transfer Operation.
A high positive voltage is applied to the primary transfer roller to transfer
toner image from the OPC drum to the primary transfer belt.
Negative electronic charges are generated by the PTC unit, supplying negative
charges to toner. This operation improves the transfer efficiency in the 
secondary transfer. Then a high negative voltage is applied to the primary
transfer drive roller, to transfer toner images from the primary transfer
belt to paper.

NOTE when removing the waste toner cleaning unit be sure to turn the
transfer unit upside down and lift away from the cleaning unit to avoid
spillage.

In the secondary transfer unit a high positive voltage is applied to the
primary transfer belt to attach unwanted toner to the primary transfer belt,
and it is then cleaned by the primary transfer belt cleaning unit.

WASTE TONER
-----------
Waste Toner full detection sensor (TNFD)
If the waste toner box is emptied it will still show as full until the 
actuator arm is manually released. This is best done using a pair of long
nosed pliers or similar to release the clutch.

LASER UNIT (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation)
----------

Within the Griffin range a single channel laser beam configuration is used
to give 600dpi, whilst output on the Phoenix range is 1200dpi thanks to twin
channel laser beam configuration.

MAIN DRIVE
----------
The main drive units are:-
1) the main drive unit
2) the transport drive unit
3) the fusing drive unit
4) the paper exit drive unit

NOTE:- there are two drum drive motors one for the black drum, dev and
transfer and one for the colour drum and dev units. The 50/60PM machines will
have four drum motors and a transfer drive motor.

The main drive unit can easily be accessed by opening up the PCU and MC PCBs
which are hinged. The unit can then be removed and is held in by six screws,
remembering first to disengage the drums, developer units and transfer belt.

DOCUMENT FEEDER
---------------

Two types of document feeder are available with the new models:-
RSPF (Reverse Single Pass Feeder)
DSPF (Duplex Single Pass Feeder)

In the RSPF models an optical fibre is used as the exposure lamp.The DSPF 
models uses an LED bar, as used in previous models. For this reason the 
Document feeder cannot be interchanged.It must be established before placing
the order for the MFP what type of document feeder is required.

On the models with the RSPF we have adopted a new light source, by using two
refractive strips and shining a LED down the strip to provide an even amount
of light.

The DSPF models are still using the original LED array as the light source.

The RSPF Document feeder is similar to all our other models except for the
inner guide. Additionally, the lower entry guide can be lifted up for easier
paper jam removal.

The new DSPF is very similar in design to its predecessors. To simplify the
drive system there are only three (instead of 4 pcs) Drive motors and only
one type of coupling are used.

The DSPF document feeder is similar to our other models and incorporates a 
CCD scanner assembly inside to scan the second side of a document without the
need to turn it over and re-feed. This makes duplex scanning much faster. Also
this model has only one main drive motor and all clutches are the same type.

RIGHT HAND SIDE DOOR
--------------------

The right hand side door incorporates the ADU (Auto Duplex Unit) and the 
Manual Feed Tray. Also located on the right hand side door is the secondary
transfer unit, used to transfer the image from the primary transfer belt onto
the paper.

OUTPUT OPTIONS
--------------

In addition to the right exit tray unit MX-TR19, the inner exit tray MX-TU16
and the new fob separator MX-TR20, a total of five new finishers are available
to select from (MX-FN27, MX-FN28 / MX-FN29, MX-FN30 / MX-FN31). Should one of 
the external finishers be installed, the paper transfer unir MX-RB25 must
additionally be installed. All finishers can be optionally equipped with a
2/4-hole Punch Unit.

1000 finisher via the dip panel. Refer to the service manual.

eg if you need to adjust the folding position, adjust the fold staple 
position using the DIP SW - see service manual. Move the stapling position
with the values in the system settings. Remember to move the stapling and
folding positions together.

MX-FN27 inner Finisher
----------------------

Note when installing the inner finisher, ensure the punch connection harness
does not get caught.

When fitting the exit tray to the main unit, ensure the tray is fitted below
the height limit sensor. The tray can be lowered by releasing the drive by
inserting a flat blade screwdriver in a small hole at the front of the
finisher.

To edge the teeth of the stapleless staple unit after replacement, let the
Sim 3-3 -FNM9 motor run for approximately 2 to 3 minutes.

Manual staple function.
-----------------------

Note: By holding the manual staple button for 5 seconds the staple unit moves
to the staple position at the front.

MX-PN14 B/C/D

B = 2/3 Holes
C = 2/4 Holes
D = 4 Hole Wide

The optional punch unit replaces the dummy punch unit supplied with the 
MX-FN27 Inner Finisher. The Punch gets its supply and signals from the 
finisher via the connector at the rear.

MX-RB25 Paper Pass Unit
-----------------------

This unit is required when fitting an external finisher MX-FN28/29 or
MX-FN30/31. Included in the packaging is the external connector. Both the
MXRB25 and the connector connect into the rear of the machine.

MX-TU16 - Inner tray / MX-TR20 - The Job Separator along with the Interior
Shelf is designed for the Offsetting Shifter Motor Unit. The shifter motor
unit is installed in the Exit Unit. The indexer unit on the machine is
locked by a shouldered screw, this needs to be removed and a drive assembly
fitted to enable the shift mechanism (inc with the packed items). The
machine cannot be used without a finishing option or exit tray cabinet.
L4-11 code will occur. For more details please follow the instructions in the 
Installation Manual.

Note: If finisher fails in the field it can be removed to allow the machine
to work without fitting the TU16 by changing SIM 55-01 SW24-07 from 0 to 1.

MX-FN28/29 Finisher options
---------------------------

MX-RB25 is required to install this finisher. External wiring connector is
included in the RB25 packaging. A single staple unit is used for both main
stapling and saddle stitch stapling, so only one staple cartridge type is
needed for each type of finisher.
MX-FN28 = MX-SCX1 (5000 Staples)
MX-FN29 = AR-SC2 (5000 Staples)

MX-FN29 Saddle Finisher
-----------------------

If replacement of the staple unit is required, then re-alignment of the two
units must be carried out and the service tool must be used. Please refer
to the service manual MX-FN28 page 1-24

Part numbers for the tool items are as below


1, Screw M3-8, 0PQ04513008N/

5, Holder Rear, 0JEB7936420//

As pert of the general maintenance schedule, the exit rollers may need to be 
replaced.  For easier access to the rollers, there is a dip switch on the main
controller PWB which when operated will open the exit unit giving better 
access to the rollers.  For further details please refer to the service manual 
of the MX-FN28/29 page 1-24, item (41) Gathering Roller.

MX-PN15 Punch Unit (Option)
---------------------------

An option punch module can be fitted to the MX-FN28/29. Please consult the
Installation Manual for the installation procedure.

MX-PN15 B/C/D

B = 2/3 Holes
C = 2/4 Holes
D = 4 Hole Wide

MX-FN30/MX-31 3K Finisher
-------------------------

The MX-RB25 is required to install this finisher. An external wiring connector
is included in the RB25 packaging. Separate staple units are used for both
main stapling and saddle stitch stapling, so two staple cartridge types are
needed for saddle finisher.

MX-FN30/31 Main Staple = MX-SCX1 (5000 Staples)
MX-FN31 Saddle Staple = MX-SC12 (2000 Staples)

Manual stapling is available via front slot.
Staple-less stapling is available on this model.

The MX-FN30/31 external finisher can hold 3,000 sheets of paper  on the output 
tray. It also has a manual stapling capability like the smaller inner finisher 
MX-FN27, and also has staple-less stapling.

MX-PN16 Hole Punch Unit
-----------------------

A hole punch can be fitted to the FN31/31 if required.

B version = 2/3 hole
C version = 2/4 hole
D version = 4 hole/4 hole wide

Paper weight = 55-300 gsm
Unit weight = 2.5kg
Power source = Supplied by main unit

If an inner tray installed, the new job separator can also be installed for an
additional output tray. The Job Separator is activated in Sim 26-1 value 'B'.

The centre exit tray comes with a drive unit which must be fitted to drive the
indexer (Jogger) on the exit unit. Note the exit unit indexer is locked into
position with a screw, which must be removed prior to fitting the drive unit.

MX-TR20 Job Separator Tray
--------------------------

This tray can be fitted in conjunction with the centre tray cabinet (MX-TU16)
and Relay unit (MX-RB25) to allow paper output to two separate locations. IE.
Fax output can be separated from Copy and Print data, or Print data from Copy
data.


MX-TR19 Exit tray unit gives an additional paper exit option. This can be used
for Receiving Fax transmissions or to separate print jobs from copy jobs. It
has no offset function or finishing option. The unit is enabled n Test Sim
26-01.

Note: there are now three sensors on this exit unit.

MX-DE28 Tandem Desk Unit
------------------------

The two tandem cassettes of the new MX-DE28 are completely separated from
each other. An empty cassette can be filled while the paper is being fed from
the other cassette.

The MX-DE28 has one 550 sheet universal tray and two independent A4 trays,
this enables the paper to be replenished while the machine is still running.
The tandem cassettes can be removed from the device to perform maintenance
work, such as cleaning or replacing the paper feed rollers, only after
releasing (pulling) the rail stopper. The exact procedure is described in the
Service Manual.

To remove the trays, the white stopper on the rails needs to be lifted up.

The feed system is the same as the main machine, using the same feed rollers.
The rollers are different type to CR3 but are removed in a similar way.

LSS - LARGE CAPACITY CASSETTE
-----------------------------

Large capacity cassette MX-LC17 will give an extra 3000 sheet paper capacity.
Unlike previous LCC units this model has a side opening door for improved
paper refilling. This makes paper loading easier and prevents poor paper 
loading by the customer. The tray can be converted to B5 by adjusting the
side guides and rear guides.  The paper feed unit is similar to others,
however new style rollers are used.

Paper capacity (80gsm) = 3000 sheets
Paper size = A4, B5
Paper weight = 60 - 220 g/m2

CARD READER MOUNTING FRAME
--------------------------

The new design of the machine, with the control panel on the right hand side,
makes for easy card reader installation, and comfortable use by the end user.
The factory mounting frame has been standardised, so that only one frame type
is used for different card readers. The electrical connection is made via
standard USB plug at the panel. The card reader-frame is available as the 
option MX-XB52.

SIM 50-10 (print scan image off centre lead edge position adjustment) 
necessary at intitial setup of a machine for tray 1, and also for trays 
2,3,4 when you install an MX-DE25/26/27/28.
Areas to look at are the lead and tail edge and also the side to side 
adjustment (main scan and sub scan). All settings in (sim 50-10) are set to
50 by default. There will be a blue square near the lead edge. Side edges
should measure 2mm, lead and trail edge should measure 3mm. Adjustig the main
scan will effect the side to side and adjusting the sub scan will effect the 
lead and trail edge.

There is a reset which will set all settings back to 50. If you make an 
adjustment and move it back and the image doesn't move back, exit simulation
and then re-enter.
