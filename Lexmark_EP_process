# notes from Lexmark training online EP process
#phil welsby 26 january 2019

The System Board is the central control unit of the printer:
* It processes data from the PC.
* It creates the bitmap image to print.
* It controls the laser(s), LEDs, motors and mechanical functions.
* It coordinates and initiates the mechanical start of the EP process.
* This board is commonly called by other names such as Controller Board
or Motherboard.

Some printers don't have a System board but use a RIP Board and a
Engine Board.
The RIP Board:
* It processes data from the PC.
* It creates the bitmap image to print.
* It coordinates the start of the EP Process.

The Engine Board is the work horse:
* It controls the laser(s), LEDs, motors and mechanical functions.
* It initiates the mechanical start of the EP Process.
* It is controlled by the RIP Board.

Copy Quality issues due to component failure:
Photoconductor (drum)

Potential problems:
* Pits, dings or damage to the photoconductor surface.

The problem looks like:
* Repeating mark(s) of the affected colour on the printed page.
* Repeating line(s) of the affected colour on the printed page running
in the scan direction (the direction the photoconductor sits).
* Entire page is saturated with 100% of the affected colour(s).

Step 1: Charge

Potential problems:
* No charge/overcharge from the High Voltage Power Supply to the Charge 
Roller.

The problem looks like:
* Entire colour plane missing for the affected colour(s) - may also see
blank page.
* Entire page is saturated with 100% of the affected colour(s).

Cause of problem may be Charge Roller/High Voltage Power Supply.
Check connections and contacts, reinstall/replace the Charge Roller or
High Voltage Power Supply.

Potential problems:
* Pits, dings or damage to the charge roller surface causing uneven charge
to the photoconductor.

The problem looks like:
* Repeating mark(s) of the affected colour on the printed page.
 
Step 2: Expose

Potential problems:
* The Laser or LED does not expose or over-exposes the photoconductor.

The Problem looks like:
* Entire colour plane missing for the affected colour(s) - may also see
blank page.
* Entire page is saturated with 100% of the affected colour(s).

The components causing the problem:
* System Board/RIP Board Laser or LED.

Possible resolution:
* Reinstall/Replace the cables, System or RIP Board or Laser/LED.

Potential problems:
* Dust or debris on the Laser or LED Printhead.

The problem looks like:
* White lines (voids) running in the process direction (the direction the
paper travels) for each affected colour.

The components causing the problem:
* Laser or LED Printhead

Step 3: Develop

Potential problems:
* Dings, dents or debris on the Developer Roller.

The problem looks like:
* Repeating mark(s) or the affected colour(s) on the printed page.
* Repeating void(s) of the affected colour(s) on the printed page.
* White lines (voids) running in the scan direction.

The component(s) causing the problem:
* Toner Development Roller

Step 4: Transfer (no Transfer Unit)

Potential problems:
* Colour(s) are printing very light/nearly blank.

The problem looks like:
* Entire colour plane is very light/nearly blank for the affected colour(s).

The component causing the problem:
* High Voltage Power Supply / Transfer Roller.

Possible Resolution:
* Check cable connections and contacts. Reinstall/Replace the Transfer
Roller or High Voltage Power Supply.

Possible problems:
* Dents or debris on the Transfer Roller.

The problem looks like:
* Repeating void(s) on the printed page.
* Repeating mark(s) of the affected colour(s) on the printed page.

The component causing the problem:
* Transfer Roller

Step 4: Transfer (with Transfer Unit)

Potential problems:
* Dents or debris on the Transfer Roller.

The problem looks like:
* Repeating void(s) on the printed page.
* Repeating mark(s) of the affected colour(s) on the printed page.

Component causing the problem:
* Transfer Roller

Step 4: Transfer (with Transfer Unit)
