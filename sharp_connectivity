Basic Networking Requirements.

TESTING CONNECTIVITY
--------------------

ipconfig displays ip addresses of the host and other configuration info.

ipconfig/all displays all information about the connection.

ipconfig/release releases the current ip address given by the DHCP server.

ipconfig/renew requests a new ip address from the DHCP server.

nslookup reports the ip address of an entered host name or the host name of
an entered ip.

The mac address will be displayed using ipcofig/all or getmac command.


CABLING AND CONNECTORS
----------------------

Until recently most networks have used unshielded twisted pair (UTP) or
sheilded twisted pair (STP) cabling to connect computers or other devices
in the network. Both are composed of four pairs of wires. The wires in each
pair are twisted around each other, and the pairs are twisted together and
bundled within a covering.

UTP cable comes in catagories. Each catagory has a specific use, number of
twists per foot (TPF), and a speed rating. The more twists, the less 
crosstalk and electrical magnetic interference (EMI) that affects the data
on the cable.

Cat3 cable used to be the dominant, however it only operates at up to 10 Mbps
with about two or three twists per foot.

Cat5 cable is the virrent standard. It operates at up to 100 Mbps. Cat5e 
operates at up to 1 Gbps. These cables have a range of 20 twists per foot.

Cat6 cables use higher quality materials for data conduction and have the
potential to operate at up to 2.5Gbps.

RJ-45 connectors on UTP cables look a lot like the regular RJ-11 snap-in
telephone connectors, except they're a little larger. The RJ-45 connects 
8 wires, as opposed to the 6 in the RJ-11.

ETHERNET NETWORKS
-----------------

The network speed that Sharp MFP's operate at can be fixed in Test Command
55-03 Switch6. We reccommend leaviing this set to default value 'Auto'.

10-Mbps Ethernet operates at a speed of 10 megabits per second (Mbps) of data
It later became known as Ethernet IEEE 802.3

100-Mbps Ethernet (also known as Fast Ethernet) operates at a speed of100 Mbps. 
It can also handle data at 10 Mbps, and this feature allows devices
running at slower speed tooperaate on the same network with those operating at
100 Mbps.

1000 Mbps Ethernet (also called Gigabit Ethernet) operates at speed of 1000 Mbps
(1 gigabit per second). It's the newest version of Ethernet and is intended 
for large, high speed LANs and heavy-traffic server connnections. Few, if any
home networks require Gigabit Ethernet. Most current Ethernet installations
use shielded twisted pair (STP) cable, unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable, or
fibre optic cable.

NETWORK SETTINGS
----------------

The quick settings page can be used to make basic configuration changes
however it is reccommended to use the Protocol and Services settings pages to
fully configure these options.

DNS (Domain Name Service) is required for name resolution. Primary server and
secondary server (if used) must be an IP address. The domain name is in the
form 'domain.com'.

SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol) is used to enable the machine to send
e-mail for scanning or alerts. SSL will be required if using a secure mail
server.

SMTP authentication - maybe required depending on the settings of the mail
server.

SNTP (Simple Network Time Protocol) setup syncronisation with a time server.

WINS (Windows Internet Naming Service) not used much anymore. Microsoft
attempt at DNS.

Keberos very secure method of authenticating. If you are using LDAP, this
will need setting up.

SMTP Server settings

If your customer is using Microsoft Outlook and do not know their server
settings a simple way to access these would be to follow the steps below.

1) From MS Outlook select File.
2) Select Info.
3) Select Account Settings.
4) Select the Change icon.
5) The Email Server name will be displayed.

NOTE do not make any changes but cancel after noting the details.

mDNS (Multicast DNS) is the zero configutation option the MFP uses to 
advertise itself on the users network. When enabled the device will be
available in a Mac or Windows environment as a print device. Also known as
bonjour. My Computer, click network, it will browse nerwork for available
devices. Advertising themselves nia mDNS. Most IT people like to switch it off
to reduce network traffic and force printing through server.

SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) this is used to pass information
relating to the status of the device. For example SRDM (Sharp Remote Device
Manager) and Onestop will use SNMP to find out how much toner is in the MFP.
Used for Routers, servers, etc. SRDM uses this technology.

Print Port Settings.
--------------------

The LDP port will allow printing using the LPD/LPR protocol. This is enabled
by default but can be individually switched off. The Banner option if enabled
will print a job report separator page between each job.

The RAW port is usually used for Windows Printing and usually on port 9100.
Ensure 'Use bi-directional' is selected for AS400 Unix environments.

WSD (Web Services on Devices) makes the device advertise itself in windows as
a printer using mDNS. This is disabled by default on the new Generation 4
models.

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) This allows users to search for
E-Mail addresses to scan to. Port number 3268 can only be used with Win 2000
server onwards. This is the MS global catalogue so requires no search root.

Name:A user friendly title for the search.
Search Root:location of the directory that users are stored (only required
when using port 389).
LDAP Server:IP Address or Host name of server.
Server Type:only required if user details are not stored int the standard
locations.
Port Number:389 (default) or 3268
User Name:This needs to be a valid user account with rights to access an
LDAP search.
Password:Password of the above user.
Authentication Type:NTLM is reccommended for Microsoft Exchange.
Connection Test:This can be used to check the above settings.

Proxy Settings
--------------
If the customer uses a proxy server to access the internet these details can
be entered here. A proxy server is only required to access services outside of
the local network. For example when accessing cloud services. Proxy server
setttings can be added to the MFP via System Settings/Network Settings/Proxy
Setting. (Requires Admin Login).

WIRELESS NETWORKS AND MOBILE PRINTING
-------------------------------------

WLANs are popular in places where networking cables are difficult to install.
All wireless devices that communicate with each other must have the same
Service Set Identifier (SSID), which is the unique name of the wirless 
network they are using. Devices using different SSIDs can't communicate.

Wireless devices can communicate directly in what's called ad-hoc mode or
they can connect to a LAN by way of a wireless access point (WAP). Access
points are placed so that nodes can access at least one access point from 
anywhere within the coverage area. When devices use an access point, they
communicate through the access point instead of communicating directly. This
is known as infastructure mode.

Although WLANs have some obvious advantages in places where running cables
would be difficult or expensive, WLANs tend to be slower than wired networks,
especially when they are busy. Another problem with WLANs is security.
Companies are often reluctant to use them.

Wireless Connectivity has two modes.
1) Infastructure mode this will disable the wired connnection and connect
to an existing wireless access point.

2) Wired/Wireless (Ad-hoc) mode will use the wired network port but also 
create an access point of the MFP so mobile users can connect.
