NOTES FOR MEETING 28/2/2019

1) grease ordered for bearings on fuser rollers, this should help stop
   bearings from seizing onto the rollers shaft.

2) removal of gear from fusers on CR4 machines (NGERH2218FCZZ)
   does anyone have the service bulliten re removing this as I have
   been unable to find it. (Part is on page 121 item 38 of 
   MX_4070/5070 parts manual)

3) Learning to code?
