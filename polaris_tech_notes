Definition of developer/drum life end.

When the developer/drum counter reaches the specified count.
When the developer/drum rpm reaches the specified count.
When either of the above reach the specified count, it is judged as life end.

In an actual case, the ratio of monochrome output and colour output may differ greatly.
When data of mixed documents (monochrome and colour) are output, monochrome 
document data may be output in the colour mode in order to prevent against fall in the job efficiency. 
(ACS auto colour selection).
In addition, when correction or warm-up operation is performed as well as output operation, 
the developer and the drum rotates.
Therefore, the developer/drum consuming level cannot be determined only by the copy/print quantity. 
When, therefore, the rpm reaches the specified amount, it is judged as life end.
To check the developer/drum life, use SIM22-13.


Developer/Drum Counter		|				Developer/Drum RPM              |

B/W				Full colour			B/W				Full Colour
Drum 300K copies/prints		Drum 200K copies/prints		Drum 1 million rotations	Drum 1 million rotations
Developer 600K copies/prints	Developer 400K copies/prints	Developer 2 million rotations	Developer 2 million rotations

PULL PRINTING
-------------

The MX-7580N / MX-6580N and MX-7090N / MX-8090N series MFP's have a built-in Print Release capability. 
This is the same feature found on our latest range of office MFP's, users can send their print jobs to 
the master MFP which acts as the server.  From there, users can print the data from up to five client 
MFP's on the same network. 

Note: This function will be lost if the EFI Fiery option has been fitted

This means that even if someone is using the MFP and/or if the MFP cannot be used because of maintenance, 
as long as the machine set-up as the primary remains switched on, users can print the data at another 
available MFP on the same network without waiting.  

Furthermore, if no user authentication is enabled all users will see all jobs, for enhanced security 
when using this feature, it is necessary for user authentication to be enabled and for them to provide authentication.

As there is no need for a separate print server or additional software, 
this low cost pull printing solution is ideal for organisations who already 
have our latest MFP range and want basic control over their printing with 
higher flexibility.

SCREEN
------

The MX-6580N and MX-7580N both have the same built-in 10.1” multi-touch finger swipe touch colour LCD 
control panel as the CR4 as standard, users are guided step by step through operational procedures.  
This third generation touch screen is the fastest in the Sharp range meaning that users will be able 
to have a seamless experience at the MFP. 

The MX-7090N and MX8090N has a new 15.4" touch screen with all the same features and operational 
procedures as the 10.1" screen but with higher clarity, this is so that when the external fiery (MX-PE13) 
is installed the CWS (Command Work Station) can be viewed clearly.

Additionally, the retractable QWERTY keyboard (MX-KB13) enables easy text entry 
providing users more flexibility should they need it.

The CR4 screens make it easy for the operater to gain assistance on all aspects of the machine, including:

*  Downloading and printing manuals

*  Loading paper and placing originals

*  Operating the machine

*  Maintenance
