istallation = 0.00 to 1.23
command line starts at 1.23
cp su ls find touch rm mv = 1.23 to 2:36:13
grep = 2:36:13 to 2:45:44




NOTES
------
sudo chown -R phil:phil ./mydir    -> this will change recursivly all files in the 
directory. Without the switch -R it would change ownership of the directory but not 
the files in it.

sudo chmod changes the file mode bits (read, write and execute). They look like thi
s -rw-rw-r-- (664 is this instance).

rm dir/*      -> this will remove all files from a derectory but leave the directory 
intact. To remove the directory and all its contents type:-
rm - rf <directory name>

cp will copy a file to a destination eg:-
cp myfile.txt ./Documents.

mv will move a file without leaving a copy in the orginal directory eg:-
mv myfile.txt ./Documents/myfile.txt (note it is necessary to provide a file name as well
as the path).
mv is also used to rename a directory as in:-
mv mydir myNewDirectory 
This will rename the directory mydir to myNewDirectory in the
current directory.
To change the name of a file in the same directory use:-
mv myfile.txt myfile2.txt

To remove a file use the 'rm' command like this:-
rm myfile.txt. Care must be taken when doing this as there is no prompt to warn you.

The command 'touch' will create a file without having to open it.

The 'find' command.
eg:- find . -type f -name "*.php"
This will find all the .php files in the current directory.
Using '-iname' in place of '-name' will ignore case sensitivity.
-type f finds files
-type d finds directorys
omiting find finds all
-perm 0664 finds all files with -rw-rw-r-- permissions
find -type f -size -1M will find all files which are less than 1M
find -type f -size +1M will find all files which are larger than 1M
adding in -not to the line of code will find all files which are not some type
eg:-
find . -type f -not -iname "*.php" (this will find all files which do not
have the file extention .php

find searches recrusivly to disable this use (-maxdepth) eg:-
find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -name ".conf"
The 1 after -maxdepth means it only searches down one level


GREP starts at 2:36:13
----------------------
grep 'jamming' MASTER.txt     < this will search for the word 'jamming' in the file 'MASTER.txt
adding the -i switch will do an non case sensitive search
adding the -w switch will do a word specific search ie 'jam' but not 'jamming'
adding the -n switch will add the line number

'find' and 'grep' can be combined to find a file and then search it:-
find . -type f iname '*.py' -exec grep -i -n 'function' {} +
THE ABOVE WILL SEARCH ALL FILES ENDING IN .py AND THEN EXECUTE A grep SEARCH FOR THE WORD 'function'
non case sensitive and give line numbers.


HOW TO REDIRECT A FILE
----------------------
eg:-
ls > output.txt
this will output the 'ls' command to the file output.txt instead of printing it to the screen.

find . -type f iname '*.py' -exec grep -i -n 'function' {} + > function_in_python.txt
the above command will output the result to a file called function_in_python.txt instead 
of printing to the screen.

find . -type f iname '*.py' -exec grep -i -n 'function' {} + | tee function_in_python.txt 
in the above code the pipe command '| tee function_in_python.txt' has been used. And this 
will output the result to the file 'function_in_python.txt' and print to the screen.
