installation = 0.00 to 1.23
command line starts at 1.23
cp su ls find touch rm mv = 1.23 to 2:36:13
grep = 2:36:13 to 2:45:44

NOTES
------
sudo chown -R phil:phil ./mydir    -> this will change recursivly all files in the 
directory. Without the switch -R it would change ownership of the directory but not 
the files in it.

sudo chmod changes the file mode bits (read, write and execute). They look like thi
s -rw-rw-r-- (664 is this instance).

rm dir/*      -> this will remove all files from a directory but leave the directory 
intact. To remove the directory and all its contents type:-
rm - rf <directory name>

cp will copy a file to a destination eg:-
cp myfile.txt ./Documents.

mv will move a file without leaving a copy in the orginal directory eg:-
mv myfile.txt ./Documents/myfile.txt (note it is necessary to provide a file name as well
as the path).
mv is also used to rename a directory as in:-
mv mydir myNewDirectory 
This will rename the directory mydir to myNewDirectory in the
current directory.
To change the name of a file in the same directory use:-
mv myfile.txt myfile2.txt

To remove a file use the 'rm' command like this:-
rm myfile.txt. Care must be taken when doing this as there is no prompt to warn you.

The command 'touch' will create a file without having to open it.

The 'find' command.
eg:- find . -type f -name "*.php"
This will find all the .php files in the current directory.
Using '-iname' in place of '-name' will ignore case sensitivity.
-type f finds files
-type d finds directorys
omiting find finds all
-perm 0664 finds all files with -rw-rw-r-- permissions
find -type f -size -1M will find all files which are less than 1M
find -type f -size +1M will find all files which are larger than 1M
adding in -not to the line of code will find all files which are not some type
eg:-
find . -type f -not -iname "*.php" (this will find all files which do not
have the file extention .php

find searches recrusivly to disable this use (-maxdepth) eg:-
find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -name ".conf"
The 1 after -maxdepth means it only searches down one level


GREP starts at 2:36:13
----------------------
grep 'jamming' MASTER.txt     < this will search for the word 'jamming' in the file 'MASTER.txt
adding the -i switch will do an non case sensitive search
adding the -w switch will do a word specific search ie 'jam' but not 'jamming'
adding the -n switch will add the line number

'find' and 'grep' can be combined to find a file and then search it:-
find . -type f iname '*.py' -exec grep -i -n 'function' {} +
THE ABOVE WILL SEARCH ALL FILES ENDING IN .py AND THEN EXECUTE A grep SEARCH FOR THE WORD 'function'
non case sensitive and give line numbers.


HOW TO REDIRECT A FILE
----------------------
eg:-
ls > output.txt
this will output the 'ls' command to the file output.txt instead of printing it to the screen.

find . -type f iname '*.py' -exec grep -i -n 'function' {} + > function_in_python.txt
the above command will output the result to a file called function_in_python.txt instead 
of printing to the screen.

find . -type f iname '*.py' -exec grep -i -n 'function' {} + | tee function_in_python.txt 
in the above code the pipe command '| tee function_in_python.txt' has been used. And this 
will output the result to the file 'function_in_python.txt' and print to the screen.

PROCESSES 2:45:30

top - shows processes running in real time.  PID is process ID
ps aux - shows the entire list as a capture
ps aux can also be piped to grep to show running processes as in:-
ps aux | grep firefox

in order to get the PID (process ID) of an application use pgrep as in:-
pgrep firefox

you can use the kill command to stop or kill a process using its PID number as in:-
kill -9 5274 this will kill process 5274 whatever that may be.

if there are several processes running of the same type and you wish to kill them all
you can use the killall commmand followed by the application name as in:-
killall firefox

SERVICES 2:52:37
